## **Project Description**

**CT Beauty** is a clean, responsive salon booking app ‚Äî a **Django MVP** focused on the core experience: discover services, pick a treatment, and book a time slot with minimal friction. The UI is mobile-first (Bootstrap 5) with a calm, brand-led palette and accessible forms.

### What it does
- **Browse services** by category with clear descriptions, durations, and prices.
- **Book a slot**: choose a treatment, then select an available time.
- **Manage bookings (CRUD)**:
  - **Create** a booking
  - **Read** your upcoming bookings
  - **Update** (reschedule) by changing availability
  - **Delete** by cancelling the booking
- **Secure auth**: sign up / sign in with **django-allauth** (username or email), strong password rules, and brute-force protection via **django-axes**.

### How it works (at a glance)
1. **Services & Treatments** are defined in the database (admin supports full CRUD).
2. **Availability slots** represent bookable times; a **Booking** occupies one slot.
3. **Users** authenticate via allauth; protected views handle booking **CRUD** (reschedule = update).
4. The interface stays consistent across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

> Goal: deliver a smooth, trustworthy booking experience with clear information, minimal friction, and consistent styling across pages.

  **5.** As a customer, I want to receive a booking success message, so that I know my booking is successful.

  **6.** As a user, I want to cancel or change my booking, So that I can manage my schedule as needed.

- **Milestone: Implementing User Registration and Login**.

  **1.** As a new customer, I want to register an account, So that I can log in and make a booking for a treatment.

  **2.** As a logged-in user, I want to log out of my account so that I can ensure my data is secure.

  **3.** As a user who forgot my password, I want to reset it using my email, So that I can regain access to my account.

  **4.** As a registered user, I want to log in to my account, so that I can access my personal dashboard and make or manage bookings.

## **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**

![CT Beauty ERD](static/images/ERD-Models.jpg)

## **Entities**

#### Category
- Groups services (e.g., Brows, Lashes, Waxing).
- Fields: `name`, `slug`.

#### Treatment
- A bookable service that belongs to a category.
- Fields: name, description, duration (mins), price, slug.
- FK: `category` ‚Üí Category.

#### Availability
- A single bookable slot on a specfic date & time.
- Fields: `date`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `duration`, `unavailable`, `is_booked`.

#### AvailabilityBlock

- Defines recurring opening hours across a date range.
- Fields: `start_date`, `end_date`, `start_time`, `end_time`.
- M2M: `days_of_week` ‚Üí Weekday.
- <em>Used by code to generate many Availability rows (no direct FK to slots)</em>.

#### Weekday

- Lookup for days of the week.
- Fields: `number (0‚Äì6)`, `name`.

> Note: AvailabilityBlock + Weekday are used to create the Availability schedule. This is a conceptual ‚Äúgenerates‚Äù link handled in code, not a database FK.

#### Booking

- A user‚Äôs appointment for a specific slot & treatment.
- Fields: `notes`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
- One-to-one: availability ‚Üí Availability (each slot can be booked once).
- FKs: `user` ‚Üí User, treatment ‚Üí Treatment.

#### User

- Django auth user (email/username) who makes bookings.

### Integrity Rules

- **No double-booking**: Booking ‚Üî Availability is one-to-one; chosen slot is set is_booked=True.

- **Future & duration-matched**: only future slots that match the treatment‚Äôs duration are offered.

- **Delete behaviour**:
  * Booking.user ‚Üí CASCADE (deleting a user removes their bookings).
  * Booking.treatment, Booking.availability ‚Üí PROTECT (avoid orphaned bookings).

### Typical Flow

**1.** Admin creates AvailabilityBlocks (e.g., Mon‚ÄìFri 09:00‚Äì17:00 for a month) ‚Üí app generates Availability slots.

**2.** User selects a Treatment; form lists only future, duration-compatible slots.

**3.** On submit, a Booking is created and the chosen Availability is marked booked.

**4.** When rescheduling, only the availability (time) is changed; the previous slot is freed.
