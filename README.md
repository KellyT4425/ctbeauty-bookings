## **Project Description**

**CT Beauty** is a clean, responsive salon booking app ‚Äî a **Django MVP** focused on the core experience: discover services, pick a treatment, and book a time slot with minimal friction. The UI is mobile-first (Bootstrap 5) with a calm, brand-led palette and accessible forms.

### What it does
- **Browse services** by category with clear descriptions, durations, and prices.
- **Book a slot**: choose a treatment, then select an available time.
- **Manage bookings (CRUD)**:
  - **Create** a booking
  - **Read** your upcoming bookings
  - **Update** (reschedule) by changing availability
  - **Delete** by cancelling the booking
- **Secure auth**: sign up / sign in with **django-allauth** (username or email), strong password rules, and brute-force protection via **django-axes**.

### How it works (at a glance)
1. **Services & Treatments** are defined in the database (admin supports full CRUD).
2. **Availability slots** represent bookable times; a **Booking** occupies one slot.
3. **Users** authenticate via allauth; protected views handle booking **CRUD** (reschedule = update).
4. The interface stays consistent across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

> Goal: deliver a smooth, trustworthy booking experience with clear information, minimal friction, and consistent styling across pages.

## **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** üîÅ

![CT Beauty ERD](static/images/ERD-Models.jpg)

## **Entities** ‚ÜîÔ∏è

#### Category
- Groups services (e.g., Brows, Lashes, Waxing).
- Fields: `name`, `slug`.

#### Treatment
- A bookable service that belongs to a category.
- Fields: name, description, duration (mins), price, slug.
- FK: `category` ‚Üí Category.

#### Availability
- A single bookable slot on a specfic date & time.
- Fields: `date`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `duration`, `unavailable`, `is_booked`.

#### AvailabilityBlock

- Defines recurring opening hours across a date range.
- Fields: `start_date`, `end_date`, `start_time`, `end_time`.
- M2M: `days_of_week` ‚Üí Weekday.
- <em>Used by code to generate many Availability rows (no direct FK to slots)</em>.

#### Weekday

- Lookup for days of the week.
- Fields: `number (0‚Äì6)`, `name`.

> Note: AvailabilityBlock + Weekday are used to create the Availability schedule. This is a conceptual ‚Äúgenerates‚Äù link handled in code, not a database FK.

#### Booking

- A user‚Äôs appointment for a specific slot & treatment.
- Fields: `notes`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
- One-to-one: availability ‚Üí Availability (each slot can be booked once).
- FKs: `user` ‚Üí User, treatment ‚Üí Treatment.

#### User

- Django auth user (email/username) who makes bookings.

### Integrity Rules

- **No double-booking**: Booking ‚Üî Availability is one-to-one; chosen slot is set is_booked=True.

- **Future & duration-matched**: only future slots that match the treatment‚Äôs duration are offered.

- **Delete behaviour**:
  * Booking.user ‚Üí CASCADE (deleting a user removes their bookings).
  * Booking.treatment, Booking.availability ‚Üí PROTECT (avoid orphaned bookings).

### Typical Flow

**1.** Admin creates AvailabilityBlocks (e.g., Mon‚ÄìFri 09:00‚Äì17:00 for a month) ‚Üí app generates Availability slots.

**2.** User selects a Treatment; form lists only future, duration-compatible slots.

**3.** On submit, a Booking is created and the chosen Availability is marked booked.

**4.** When rescheduling, only the availability (time) is changed; the previous slot is freed.

## **Design** ‚úèÔ∏è
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Permanent+Marker)<br>
![Fredericka the Great](static/images/google-fonts-main.png)<br>
![Baskervville](static/images/font-text.png)<br>
> Fredericka the Great <br>
> Baskervville <br>

This font pairing was chosen to:

- Differentiate hierarchy (decorative headers vs. clean body text).

- Reflect brand identity (luxury, creativity, and professionalism).

- Maintain accessibility, since serif fonts with high stroke contrast like Baskervville remain readable at body text sizes, while Fredericka the Great is used sparingly for emphasis.

[Favicons](https://favicon.io/) were created using the project‚Äôs CT Beauty branding to maintain a consistent identity across devices and platforms.<br>
![Favicon Generator](static/images/favicon-generator.png) <br>
**Purpose:**

- Provides a recognizable brand symbol in browser tabs, bookmarks, and on mobile devices.

- Ensures the application looks professional and polished across platforms.

- Enhances user trust and usability, making the site easy to identify.

[Colour Palette Generator](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/)
> The brand palette for CT Beauty consists of four main colours:

- Pearl Bush (#E3DAD2) ‚Äì soft neutral background shade

- Fuscous Gray (#555350) ‚Äì deep gray, ideal for text and accents

- Whiskey (#CF9274) ‚Äì warm peach tone for highlights and accents

- Hemp (#8C7C78) ‚Äì muted mauve-brown for secondary elements

These colours were chosen to reflect a modern, professional, and calming aesthetic while maintaining good readability and accessibility. <br>
![Colour Palette](static/images/palette-colour-theme.png)


## **Accessibility**

[EightShapes](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/)
> The EightShapes contrast grid was used as it helps to ensure our chosen colour palette provides enough contrast between text and background colours for users with visual impairments. The grid was provided all colours that the Colour Palette Generated provided based off of the sites main image. <br>
![Contrast Grid](static/images/contrast-table-grid.png)

The [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) Accessibility Tool was used throughout development to test and improve the site‚Äôs accessibility. It highlights errors, contrast issues, missing alternative text, and ARIA labels directly on the rendered page. All issues raised by WAVE have been edited. <br>
![Wave](static/images/wave-example.png)

## **Validation** üîç

[CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#)

> **CI Python Linter** The project was validated using the CI Python Linter, which checks code against PEP8 standards.

- **Result**: All files passed validation, with the exception of a few E501 line too long warnings.

- **Explanation**: These warnings occur on lines where reducing the character count would break readability or functionality ‚Äî for example, long querysets, form field definitions, or model configurations that need to stay on a single line for clarity

[Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/) was used during development to step through code execution visually. This tool provides an interactive way to see how variables change, how functions are called, and how data flows through the program line by line. It was especially helpful for debugging complex logic, understanding the order of operations, and building confidence in how Python executes code.

W3 HTML 5 [Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) checks complete on full deployed Heroku URL<br>
![HTML](static/images/html-validation.png)

Jigsaw W3 CSS 3  [Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - The CSS files were tested with the W3C CSS Validator using the deployed site URL.
- **Result**: The code passed validation with the exception of vendor-prefixed properties (e.g., -webkit- and -moz-).
- **Explanation**: These are vendor-specific extensions added for cross-browser compatibility, particularly for handling animations and font smoothing on WebKit (Safari/Chrome) and Mozilla (Firefox) engines. They are not errors, but intentional additions to ensure consistent styling across browsers.
- **Decision**: These properties were retained to preserve user experience and compatibility.

> However Custom `style.css` file was run through the Jigsaw W3 Validator and came back with no errors. <br>

![CUSTOM](static/images/custom-css.png)

[JSHint](https://jshint.com/) | The JavaScript code was validated using JSHint.

> **Warnings**: JSHint flagged the use of modern ES6+ features (const, arrow functions =>, and optional chaining ?.) as only being available in later versions of ECMAScript.

 - **Resolution**: These warnings are not actual errors, but compatibility notes. The project intentionally uses ES6+ syntax for cleaner and more maintainable code.

- **Summary**: No functional errors were found, and the script works as expected in modern browsers that support ES6+.

## **Testing**üîß
Manual tests were carried out to ensure the functionality of all main features.

- Form inputs were tested for validation and correct behavior.

- Buttons and navigation links were checked for responsiveness and expected results.

- Edge cases (empty fields, invalid data, incorrect routes) were verified.

- Browser compatibility and responsiveness were tested across different screen sizes.

A full breakdown of the test cases, results, and screenshots can be found in the [‚û°Ô∏è Manual Tests](TESTING.md)

#### **Lighthouse**
Lighthouse (built into Chrome DevTools) was used to audit the site for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.
